HOW TO INSTALL ARB ON LINUX OR MAC-OS PCs

Arb itself can be downloaded here: https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/arb/releases

Arb has the following dependencies:

GMP (http://www.gmplib.org) 5.1.0 or later.
MPFR (http://www.mpfr.org) 3.0.0 or later.
FLINT (http://www.flintlib.org) version 2.5

Download and unpack all of the above:

For Linux/Mac:

sudo su

goto: usr/local/lib/

mkdir mathlibs

move each of the four folders ARB-x.x, GMP-y.y etc. into folder mathlibs:

cd GMP-x.x:
./configure
make install

cd MPFR-x.x:
./configure
make install

cd FLINT-2.7.1 (takes long)
./configure
make install

cd ARB-x.x:
./configure
make install

To compile with links to the required libraries:

gcc c-file.c -o runname —lgmp larb -lflint -lmpfr -lpthread

To run the compiled code:
./runname +parameters

Only in case the above doesn't work:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH = /usr/local/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
